# GitBusters

**Blockchain-powered bounty system for open source development. Anyone -- human or bot -- can contribute and get paid in ETH.**

---

## What is GitBusters?

GitBusters is an end-to-end platform that bridges GitHub workflows with blockchain-based escrow payments. Maintainers post bounties on GitHub issues by adding a label, and the system automatically:

- Creates an **on-chain bounty** funded with ETH
- Generates a **PRD** (Product Requirements Document) and **QA criteria** using AI agents
- **Estimates complexity** and suggests a bounty amount
- Tracks **contributor solutions** as pull requests
- **Pays out automatically** when a PR is merged

The entire flow -- from issue creation to payout -- is trustless and transparent, powered by Solidity smart contracts on any EVM-compatible chain.

## Key Features

- **On-chain escrow** -- Bounty funds are locked in a smart contract until a solution is accepted. No middleman.
- **GitHub-native workflow** -- Label an issue with `bounty` and everything happens automatically via webhooks.
- **AI-powered analysis** -- Four agent plugins (PRD, Estimator, QA, Reviewer) analyze issues and evaluate solutions.
- **Multiple competing solutions** -- Any number of contributors can submit PRs. The best one gets paid when merged.
- **Automatic payout** -- When a maintainer merges a PR, the escrow releases funds to the contributor's wallet.
- **Reputation system** -- The Leaderboard contract tracks completed bounties, payouts, and reputation scores for all participants.
- **Human or bot contributors** -- Both humans and automated agents can claim and solve bounties.
- **Web3 dashboard** -- A Next.js frontend with RainbowKit wallet connection for browsing bounties and leaderboards.

## Tech Stack
